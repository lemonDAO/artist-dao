lemonDAO rethinks commissioned work. Artists visit lemonDAO to create a sub-DAO called an artistDAO. Everyone can join these artistDAOs and propose a task via a bounty. Artists can accept the task and create the requested artwork. Once done, the artist posts completed artwork and claims the bounty. The lemonDAO community acts as a governance body to help decide cases where the artist and artistDAO community disagree on the delivery.

In addition, the lemonDAO community acts as a curator community. artistDAOs issue curator tokens, which can be used to stake on the different artworks.

This is still early alpha. You can create an artistDAO and propose. Posting the created artifacts and claiming the reward is not supported yet.
